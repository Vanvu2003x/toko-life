# Tokyo Home Website Clone 🗼

This project is a static HTML/CSS clone of select pages from the [Tokyo Home](https://tokyo-home.net/) website. It allows for offline viewing and local development testing.

## 📂 Cloned Pages

The following pages have been fully cloned with local assets:

-   **🏠 Home:** `index.html`
-   **📰 News:** `news.html`
-   **🏢 Rental Mansion:** `rental-mansion.html`
-   **🏘️ Rental Apartment:** `rental-apartment.html`
-   **🗝️ Rental Kasiya:** `rental-kasiya.html`
-   **🏪 Rental Store:** `rental-store.html`

## 🚀 How to Run

Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser. No server or database is required!

```bash
# Example
start index.html
```

## 🛠️ Features & Notes

-   **Local Assets:** All CSS, JavaScript, and Images are downloaded locally to `css/`, `js/`, and `images/`.
-   **Fixed Navigation:** Internal links between the cloned pages have been updated to relative paths.
-   **Placeholder Links:** Links to individual blog posts or specific property details (which were not cloned) are disabled (set to `#`) to prevent 404 errors while maintaining the visual layout.
